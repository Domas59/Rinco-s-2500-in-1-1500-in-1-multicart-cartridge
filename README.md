I created a replica of the PCB. 
The author of the Gala code is Narn. https://forums.nesdev.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=35555
I found the batch file for 1500 in 1 on (https://forum.pegasus-gry.com/index.php?topic=7827.0), and its author is rime.
The 7000in1 I copied myself. My next project is golden v I just have to get it cheap. 
If anyone has the possibility to copy 2500in 1 please contact me
